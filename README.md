# Introduction
The food delivery industry has grown rapidly with the use of digital platforms such as Zomato. This project aims to analyze restaurant data to understand customer preferences, pricing patterns, ratings, and location-based trends using data analytics techniques.

# Objective of the Project
<br>1. To analyze restaurant ratings and reviews
<br>2. To study pricing and cost distribution
<br>3. To identify popular cuisines and restaurant types
<br>4. To understand location-wise restaurant trends
<br>5. To generate business insights for decision-making

# Tools & Technologies Used
<br>1. Programming Language: Python
<br>2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
<br>3. Dataset Format: CSV

# Methodology
<br>1. Data collection and understanding
<br>2. Data cleaning (handling missing values and duplicates)
<br>3. Data preprocessing and transformation
<br>4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
<br>5. Data visualization and interpretation

# Exploratory Data Analysis
<br>1. Distribution of restaurant ratings
<br>2. Cost analysis across different locations
<br>3. Cuisine popularity analysis
<br>4. Online delivery and table booking trends
<br>5. Relationship between ratings and pricing

# Key Insights & Findings
